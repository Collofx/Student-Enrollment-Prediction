# Student Enrollment Prediction Model

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict which students are likely to enroll in a specific program and which students may need additional support to graduate. We use historical enrollment data, academic records, and demographic data to train the model.

## Features

- Predict student enrollment status (Enrolled / Not Enrolled).
- Identify which students may need additional support to graduate.
- Use of RandomForestClassifier for classification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - joblib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-enrollment-prediction.git
